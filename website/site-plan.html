      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I will use this website to showcase my academic and professional achievements.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <p>The United States Department of Labor confirms that the unemployment rate for 2022 is around 3.8%. This is one of the highest percentages of unemployment in the US in recent years. Thus, when people try to change jobs, they often ask themselves, where is the best place to present in detail the projects they have been involved in and show off their creativity. Currently, there are very useful pages like LinkedIn where people can present their general information and work experience, but the format is not the most creative and the space is limited. Therefore, my idea is to create a web page where people can submit more details of their work experience to job recruiters.</p>

      <h3>General Information</h3>
      <p>
        It is important to show my general data. For example, my education and previous jobs. I have unlimited space on this page, so I can detail my work experience better than on other websites. I have had the opportunity to work for many in the same area, so here I can define in detail what the differences are between my works even if the titles are similar..

      <h3>Projects/Work Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the economic conflicts that are taking place on the planet and the pandemic, it has been difficult to get a job. Also, there are pages to post my resume online. However, the space to display my work experience is limited, so I can only put general information. Therefore, I consider it important to make a website that shows my skills and knowledge so that job recruiters can see in more detail the projects that I have made to increase my chances of finding a job.
